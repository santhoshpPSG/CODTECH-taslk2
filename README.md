# Grade Calculator Project Overview
Objective: The primary objective of the Grade Calculator project is to develop a program that calculates the average grade of a student based on the scores of individual subjects or assignments. The program can also determine the corresponding letter grade and, in some cases, the GPA (Grade Point Average).

Key Components:
User Input:

The program should prompt the user to enter the number of subjects or assignments and the corresponding grades.

Validation:

The program should include validation to ensure that the entered grades are within an acceptable range (typically 0 to 100).

Calculation:

The program should calculate the total and average grades.

Letter Grade Assignment:

Based on the average grade, the program should assign a corresponding letter grade (e.g., A, B, C, D, F).

GPA Calculation (Optional):

The program can also calculate the GPA based on the average grade.

Output:

The results should be displayed to the user in a clear and concise manner.
